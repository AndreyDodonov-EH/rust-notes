- Rust has packets (crates)
- Rust's backend is LLVM
- Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded and can contain any Unicode character
- Rust has [hygienic macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro), println! is an example of this 
- Everything is constant by default, you need to add `mut` to make a variable
- Compile time memory safety
- Lack of undefined runtime behavior
- Static memory management at compile time:
    - No uninitialized variables.
    - No memory leaks (mostly, see notes).
    - No double-frees.
    - No use-after-free.
    - No NULL pointers.
    - No forgotten locked mutexes.
    - No data races between threads.
    - No iterator invalidation.
- No undefined behavior at runtime:
    - Array access is bounds checked.
    - Integer overflow is defined (panic or wrap-around).
- _Actionable_ feedback on errors
- Good Language Server Protocol implementation (rust-analyzer)
- `char` is 32 bits wid
- possible to have underscores and types directly in constant, e.g. `1_000`, `123_i64`, or, less nice `1_23i32`
- variable shadowing is possible (i.e. redefining in the same scope)... Strange
- array length is part of it's type: [u8; 3] and [u8; 4] are different types
